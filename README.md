Rainydays makes rain jackets for active and adventurous people.

## Description

- This was my first project, and my motivation was to learn more about HTML and CSS and create a whole, functioning website
- I built the website to show how I would sell rain jackets to active and adventurous people, using colorful jackets and images showing active and smiling people.
- I learned a lot on building a responsive website, on accessibility, styling in terms of colors and typography, and designing a website based on a target group.

### Planned changes

- Updating the "Add to cart"-function which changed after adding WP REST API.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Wordpress REST API
